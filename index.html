        <h1>Class GitHub Pages</h1>
        <p>These are the first GitHub pages that were created by students in Web Design 2025<br>
        For these pages, they needed to have an <span>image, heading, & description of the image</span><br>
        They also needed to have some styles in an external file as well.<br>They then had to push their code to GitHub using the terminal.<br> Below are the steps for that in the terminal</p>
        <ul>
            <h2>terminal Steps</h2>
            <li>Go into GitBash</li>
            <li>Check the status of their files with <span>git status</span></li>
            <li>Add all files with <span>git add .</span></li>
            <li>Write a short description of their file changes with <span>git commit -m "Their message text"</span></li>
            <li>Send code to GitHub with <span>git push</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once that was done, the next step is to create a page using GitHub and to share their URL link in Google Classroom</p>
        <p>Those pages can be seen in the link below:</p>
